title: About Jekyll Bootstrap Blog
---
Jekyll Bootstrap Blog is an experiment by [Andrew Shell](http://blog.andrewshell.org/)
to create a ready to go website for GitHub Pages with minimal configuration and 
knowledge of Jekyll.

The idea is someone would copy this sites code, make a few tweaks and be ready
to go with their own GitHub Pages blog.
